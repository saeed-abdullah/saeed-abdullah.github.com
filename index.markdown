**Hi, I am Saeed Abdullah.**

I am an assistant professor in the College of Information Sciences
and Technology ([IST][ist-link]) at Penn State. I also lead the
[Wellbeing & Health Innovation (WHI)][whi-lab] lab.

My research spans the domains of HCI, data science, and pervasive
health technologies. I am particularly interested in developing
novel assessment and intervention methods to support health and
wellbeing.

In recent years, I have designed, developed, and deployed ubiquitous
and data-driven systems across a diverse set of domains: [sleep][sleep],
[cognitive performance][alertness], [chronic pain management][pain],
and serious mental illnesses including [bipolar disorder][bd-project]
and [PTSD][ptsd]. Take a look at the projects I have been [working
on][projects].
