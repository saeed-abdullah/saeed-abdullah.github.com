I am a PhD student in [Information Science][info-sci] at Cornell University.
My advisor is [Tanzeem Choudhury][tanzeem] and I am a member of
[People-Aware Computing][pac-group] group.

My work is focused on developing novel Ubiquitous Computing systems that
support our health and overall well-being. In particular, my research is among
the first to advance a vision for “_Circadian Computing_” — technologies
that support and adapt to our innate biological rhythms.

Almost every biological process follows a roughly 24-hour rhythm known as a
circadian rhythm.  Living against our body clocks can have grave consequences
for physical and mental well-being with an increased risk for cancer, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and mental illness. Moreover, these issues are reaching
[an epidemic level][roenneberg-nature] — a significant fraction of the global
population persistently live against their innate rhythms.

In my work, I have developed methods for passively assessing body clock
patterns, detecting the effects of disruptions using behavioral and
contextual data, and designing tools to maintain healthy rhythms.
I have applied these methods across a diverse set of domains: [sleep][sleep],
[cognitive performance][alertness], [creativity][creativity], and
serious mental illness including [bipolar disorder][moodrhythm-project] and
[schizophrenia][eureka-project]. Take a look at the projects I am
[working on](/projects).
