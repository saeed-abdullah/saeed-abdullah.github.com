I am a PhD student in [Information Science][info-sci] at Cornell University.
My advisor is [Tanzeem Choudhury][tanzeem] and I am a member of
[People-Aware Computing][pac-group] group.

Broadly, my research focuses on the design, implementation, and
deployment of systems to help maintain chronobiological stability. I am exploring
novel ways to detect disruptions in circadian rhythms, using low-level smartphone
interaction patterns, for example. I am also working on providing low-cost and
ubiquitous system to support stability for individuals with serious mental illnesses
like Bipolar Disorder. Take a look at the projects I am [working on] (/project).
