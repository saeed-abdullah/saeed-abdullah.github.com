I am a PhD student in [Information Science][info-sci] at Cornell University.
My advisor is [Tanzeem Choudhury][tanzeem] and I am a member of
[People-Aware Computing][pac-group] group.

My work, on a broad scale, focuses on providing technology-mediated care in
the context of mental health. In this new model of care, the goal is to detect
early warning signs and provide intervention even before relapse happens ---
moving from reactive to _preemptive care_. Towards that, I focus on circadian
and behavioral trends --- identifying anomalies in key daily behavior that
might be indicative of relapse, for example.

I design, develop and deploy smartphone based sensing systems for automated
detection and intervention. Our systems are currently being used in the
context of Serious Mental Illness (SMI) including
[Bipolar Disorder][moodrhythm-project] and [Schizophrenia][eureka-project].
Beyond SMI, I am also interested in understanding the effect of disruptions
on the human body clock and [supporting circadian stability][clockwise-project]
in the general population. Take a look at the projects I am
[working on](/projects).
