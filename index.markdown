**Hi, I am Saeed Abdullah**.

I am an associate professor in the College of Information Sciences and
Technology ([IST][ist-link]) at Penn State. I also lead the [Wellbeing & Health
Innovation (WHI)][whi-lab] lab.

My goal is to improve health equity and access for all. I work at the
intersection of digital health, human computer interaction (HCI), and
data science.

I am currently working on [financial technologies
(fintech) to support marginalized communities][fintech-projects],
including individuals with [bipolar disorder][bd-fintech] and [dementia]
[dementia-fintech]. I am also developing [human-centered AI systems]
[hcai-projects] for [training mental health workers][teammait],
[improving dementia care][dementia-va], [supporting palliative care]
[palliative-care], and [generating personalized health interventions]
[genai-intervention].
