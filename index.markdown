I am an assistant professor in the [College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST)][ist-link]
at Penn State.

My human-centric research spans the domains of ubiquitous computing, data
science, and pervasive health technologies. I am particularly interested in
developing novel assessment and intervention methods to support health
and well-being. I am also exploring data-driven tools for long-term user
engagement and adherence, which is crucial for the success of mHealth
systems.

In recent years, I have designed, developed, and deployed ubiquitous and
data-driven systems across a diverse set of domains: [sleep][sleep],
[cognitive performance][alertness], [creativity][creativity], and
serious mental illness including [bipolar disorder][moodrhythm-project] and
[schizophrenia][eureka-project]. Take a look at the projects I have been
[working on](/projects).
