This website uses themes and fonts created by [Eric Lawler](https://lawler.io/about/),
who graciously made them [available under the MIT license][lawler-license].
<label for="hn-link" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="hn-link" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">
I first came across these themes in
a [Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19615895). It has some interesting comments
on website readability.

I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to generate the site. It is hosted and
published using GitHub Pages. You can find the content available in
[my GitHub account][github-blog].

The website theme and template (e.g., CSS file, fonts) are available under the
