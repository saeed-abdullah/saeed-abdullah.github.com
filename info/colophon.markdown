<h2>Colophon</h2>


I used the design from [Tommi Kaikkonen][tommi-website] who modified the CSS
originally from [Wordpress Svbtle theme][wp-svbtle]. If you are interested about
typography you should definitely read [his][tommi-typography] awesome interactive guide.

I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to generate the blog, you can find the content
available at [github][github-blog].
