This websites uses a modified version of [Lanyon][lanyon-theme] theme.
For typography, I borrowed ideas from the awesome [interactive
guide][tommi-typography] by Tommi Kaikkonen.

I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to generate the site. It is hosted and published
using GitHub pages. You can find the content available in [my GitHub account][github-blog].

The CSS files of the site, as dertivative work of the Lanyon theme,
shares the same MIT license. The rest of the _textual_ content is licensed under
