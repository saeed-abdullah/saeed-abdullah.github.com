<h2> About </h2>

I am a second year PhD student in [Information Science, Cornell][info-sci]
[My group] [pac-group] does a lot of stuff in the domain of people
centric computation --- mostly making use of ubiquitous data from mobile
devices.

As a graduate student, my day-to-day activity usually consists of
collecting, taming, analyzing data in the research space of social
network, health and crowdsourcing.
