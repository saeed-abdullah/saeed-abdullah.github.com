I am a PhD student in [Information Science][info-sci] at Cornell University.

As a graduate student in [People-Aware Computing][pac-group] lab, my day-to-day
activities usually consist of building tools and taming data in the research
space of social network, health and crowdsourcing. Take a look at the projects
I am [working on] (/project).
