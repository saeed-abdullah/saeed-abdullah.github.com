I am looking for Ph.D. applicants interested in pervasive health technologies. My labâ€™s research goals revolve around designing, developing, and deploying novel sensing and intervention systems focusing on health and well-being.

Within this broad remit, there are a number of potential projects:

* Intelligent Personal Assistance focusing on health

* Conversational agents for patients with serious mental illnesses

* Long term engagement and adherence in mHealth system

* Novel sensing for continuous monitoring of sleep and cognitive performance
