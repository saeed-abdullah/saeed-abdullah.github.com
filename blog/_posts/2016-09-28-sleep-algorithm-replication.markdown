title: Replication of our phone usage based sleep algorithm
layout: post

What can your phone say about you? A lot, particularly
[when it comes to sleep](/projects/cr-distruption-phone-sensing.html).

A recent paper from [Cuttone et al.][andrea-arxiv] replicated our phone usage based
sleep algorithm from the [UbiComp 2014 paper][ubicomp-2014].  Based on the
data from 126 participants, they found that our algorithm performs similarly
to their proposed Bayesian model with remarkable accuracy and precision for
detecting sleep events (mean accuracy: 0.89 and mean F1-score: 0.83).


While a number of recent studies have used a wide array of sensors on phones
(e.g., audio, accelereometer) to assess sleep, our algorithm _only_ uses
screen on and off information. The intuition behind our algorithm is that
most phone users use their phone right after waking up and
before going to sleep. So, the algorithm looks for
longest non-usage patterns in the night to identify sleep onset and duration.
It also adjusts to individual patterns of phone usage by using a corrective
term learned over the initial training period. In our paper, we have provided
[detailed pseudo-code][ubicomp-2014]. You can also see it explained in the
slides I presented in UbiComp 2014 ([see slide 33 - 37][ubicomp-presentation]).

In our study, we evaluated the algorithm using data from 9 participants over
97 days and found that it can accurately assess sleep onset and duration.
However, all our participants were students and from 18–24 age range.

The data used by Cuttone et al., on the other hand, was collected by Sony
Mobile from 126 participants over 2–4 weeks. For ground-truth, they use
sleep data from wearables instead of journals as we did in our study.
So, the high accuracy of our algorithm in this new and potentially more
diverse dataset indicates that it is quite robust.

I am really glad that they decided to replicate our algorithm on this new
dataset. Given that the algorithm achieves high accuracy but is very low cost
(both data and computation wise), I hope these findings will encourage others
to adopt it for passive and automated sleep assessment in populations
mostly comprised of phone users.

On a broader note, I think, these results also serve as a reminder about the
usefulness of _soft-sensing_ — data about how we use our digital devices. Given
much of our daily behavior now gets mediated through these devices, it is of
no surprise that soft-sensing can provide unique insights about our
behavior and contexts.
