We often think of ourselves as individuals with steady capabilities. However,
converging strands of research indicate that this is not the case --- our biochemistry
varies significantly over the course of a 24 hour period; and consequently our
levels of alertness, productivity, physical activity, and even sensitivity to
pain can vary according to the time of day. This project focuses on identifying
novel measurements and interventions that can leverage these daily variations.
Our findings demonstrate that phone usage patterns can be used to detect and
predict individual daily variations indicative of temporal preference, sleep
deprivation, and the effects of social jet lag.

Being able to unobtrusively measure biological misalignments means there is also
an opportunity for technology to play to our biological strengths. Incorporating
an awareness of individual biochemical variations could have a significant impact
on a wide range of technologies and help support increased well-being, productivity,
and higher quality of sleep.
