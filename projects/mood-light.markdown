Recognized stress management techniques include cultivating mindfulness, breathing exercises, and meditation. While these approaches have been shown to mitigate the negative effects of stress, they can be difficult to learn or consistently apply. To address this challenge, we developed MoodLight, a playful system that uses ambient colored light to provide feedback regarding an individual’s current stress levels.
