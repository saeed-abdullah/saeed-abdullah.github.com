Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by psychotic
symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, cognitive deficits, and
significant impairments in social and occupational functioning. Although
schizophrenia is a chronic disease, it is not static, and the majority of
people with schizophrenia fluctuate between periods of remission and episodes
of psychotic relapse. Relapse does not occur without warning. There is
substantial evidence suggesting psychotic relapses are often preceded by
periods of social isolation, depression, stressed interactions with others,
changes in physical activity, and sleep irregularities.

The EUREKA project aims to develop a mobile health system that leverages the
sensors already built into smartphones to detect both behavioral and emotional
patterns that might be early warning signs of psychotic relapses. Being able to
detect these patterns, time-sensitive interventions could be delivered to
effectively help patients with schizophrenia prevent full psychotic relapses
and hospitalization.
