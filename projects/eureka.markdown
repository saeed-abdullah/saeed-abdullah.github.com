Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, cognitive deficits, and significant impairments in social and occupational functioning. Although schizophrenia is a chronic disease, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia fluctuate between periods of remission and episodes of psychotic relapse. Relapse does not occur without warning. There is substantial evidence suggesting psychotic relapses are often preceded by periods of social isolation, depression, stressed interactions with others, changes in physical activity, and sleep irregularities.

The EUREKA project aims to develop a mobile health system that leverages the sensors already built into smartphones to detect both behavioral and emotional patterns that might be early warning signs of psychotic relapses. Being able to detect these patterns, time-sensitive interventions could be delivered to effectively help patients with schizophrenia prevent full psychotic relapses and hospitalization.
