Mental health issues are increasingly prevalent among younger generation. For
75% of individuals with mental health problems, the age of onset is prior to
[24 years][ronald-jama]. College students are known to suffer from mental
health issues that can negatively impact academic performance, social
relationship and overall well-being. Based on data from 19,861 students over
40 schools, the 2015 National College Health Assessment
([ACHA-NCHA II](acha-ncha])) found that 35.3% students “felt so depressed that
it was difficult to function” and 9.6% students have seriously considered
suicide at least once in last 12 months.

However, often these mental health issues remain untreated and undiagnosed.
The proportion of students with apparent mental disorders who are not receiving
treatment is [as high as 80%][blanco-jama]. The resulting treatment gap can be particularly
problematic as mental health problems are known to co-occur. [Eisenberg et al.][eisenberg-lww]
found that 67% of students with depression had at least one co-occurring mental
health problem including suicide ideation, panic disorder and self-injury. As
such, if these issues are not detected and treated early, it can have serious
consequences for academic and overall well-being in the long run.
